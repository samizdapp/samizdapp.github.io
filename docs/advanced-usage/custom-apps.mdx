# Installing Custom Apps

You can host your own applications on your box by installing them as custom
apps.

<InfoBox>
  Currently, custom apps are not able to interact with other apps, talk to other
  boxes, or be accessed from the client via the SamizdApp network. Check back
  for new updates as we continue to improve this feature.
</InfoBox>

## `POST` to `/app/manifests` API

Custom apps are docker compose manifests that are managed by our REST API.

You can install a new custom app by sending a `POST` request to
`http://samizdapp.local/smz/api/app/manifests` with the following body:

- `name`: Name of your app.
- `manifest`: JSON-encoded contents of a docker compose manifest your app will run.

This `POST` body would create an app named `my-jupyter-app` that runs an
instance of jupyter, using the `jupyter/minimal-notebook` docker image.

```json
{
  "name": "my-jupyter-app",
  "manifest": "\nservices:\n  jupyter-minimal:\n    image: jupyter/minimal-notebook\n    network_mode: host\n"
}
```

## Wait For Your App to Start

After the POST request is sent, your box, assuming it is currently running,
will being installing your app. Depending on the size of your app and the speed
of your box's internet connection, this could take up to several minutes.

You can ssh into your box and run:

```bash
balena-engine container ls | grep $YOUR_APP_NAME
```

to see when your app has started.

Once your app is running, you should be able to access it via `samizdapp.local`
or the IP address of your box via whatever ports it is listening on.
